## Key Features Implementation

### Database (SQLite)
- Stores disease detection cases locally
- CRUD operations for diagnosis history
- Persistent storage across app sessions

### Navigation Flow
```
Splash → Onboarding → Login → MainApp (Tabs)
                                  ├── Home
                                  ├── Disease (Capture → Form → Result)
                                  ├── Market (Prices/Prediction/Stocks)
                                  └── Residue (BookPickup/ViewRequests)
```

### Mock Data
- Disease detection uses simulated AI results
- Market prices are sample data
- Price predictions are mock forecasts
- Can be replaced with real API integration

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate real ML model for disease detection
- [ ] Connect to live mandi price APIs
- [ ] Add user profile and settings screens
- [ ] Implement real OTP authentication
- [ ] Add multilingual support (Hindi, Punjabi, etc.)
- [ ] Weather API integration
- [ ] Push notifications for price alerts
- [ ] Social features (farmer community)
